Check if a is equal to b. String comparison is case-insensitive - use `isEqualTo` if case sensitivity is needed.

*a and b types must match: comparing e.g String with Number is invalid.*

```sqf
"MyRabbit" == "MYRABBIT"; //Â returns true
```

```sqf
if (player == leader group player) then
{
	hint "You are the leader of your group.";
}
else
{
	hint "Someone else is the boss";
};
```
