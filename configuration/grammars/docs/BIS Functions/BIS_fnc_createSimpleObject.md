Creates non-simulated framerate and network performance friendly object - a `Arma 3: Simple Objects|Simple Object` - and applies different adjustments to fake non-existing physX and engine interactions. The adjustments need either to be stored in the object config or provided as the function input, otherwise they need to be done manually.<br>
<br>
Simple objects cannot be destroyed and do not interact with the environment. They are useful for creating low performance-demanding static compositions (walls, rocks, wrecks, â€¦) and/or environments where shooting and collisions are not expected.
