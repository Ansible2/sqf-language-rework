Sets a picture to be displayed on the right of the `Diary` subject. The picture can also be set during custom `Diary` subject ` creation`, but this command also allows to change icon for the fixed subjects, like "Tasks", "Diary", "Units", "Players" and "Statistics".

*Example 1:*
```sqf
player setDiarySubjectPicture ["Diary", "\A3\ui_f\data\map\markers\nato\o_mech_inf.paa"];
```
