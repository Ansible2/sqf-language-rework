In a nutshell, this command removes gaming `Side` (see `createCenter`). If a side has >0 `Group`s it cannot be deleted. Center can only be created for: `east`, `west`, `resistance`, `civilian` and `sideLogic`, therefore only centers from the mentioned sides can be deleted.<br><br>
`Old description:` Destroys the AI center of the given side.

*Example 1:*
